      See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs

SDK Wrapper:
  client.chat.completions.parse()
    - Wrapper for client.chat.completions.create().
    - Provides richer integrations with Python types.
    - Returns a ParsedChatCompletion object (subclass of ChatCompletion).

Restrictions for .parse():
  - Raises LengthFinishReasonError or ContentFilterFinishReasonError if finish_reason is 'length' or 'content_filter'.
  - Only accepts strict function tools (e.g., {'type': 'function', 'function': {..., 'strict': True}}).

TITLE: OpenAI API Reference - Polling Helpers
DESCRIPTION: Helper functions provided by the SDK to poll asynchronous API actions until they reach a terminal state. These methods simplify the management of operations that take time to complete, such as starting runs or uploading files.

SOURCE: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#_snippet_15

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
Polling Helper Functions:

These functions poll the status of asynchronous operations until a terminal state is reached, returning the resulting object. They are indicated by methods ending in `_and_poll`.

- **Thread and Run Operations**:
  - `client.beta.threads.create_and_run_poll(...)`: Creates a thread and polls for run completion.
  - `client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll(...)`: Creates a run and polls for completion.
  - `client.beta.threads.runs.submit_tool_outputs_and_poll(...)`: Submits tool outputs for a run and polls for completion.

- **Vector Store Operations**:
  - `client.beta.vector_stores.files.upload_and_poll(...)`: Uploads a file to a vector store and polls for completion.
  - `client.beta.vector_stores.files.create_and_poll(...)`: Creates a file entry in a vector store and polls for completion.
  - `client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.create_and_poll(...)`: Creates a file batch for a vector store and polls for completion.
  - `client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.upload_and_poll(...)`: Uploads a file batch to a vector store and polls for completion.

*Polling Frequency*: The polling frequency can be controlled via the `poll_interval_ms` argument available in these methods.
```
