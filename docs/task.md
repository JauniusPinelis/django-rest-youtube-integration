# Developer Technical Test: YouTube Integration Simulation (Django)

## Goal
Build a small Django project that simulates a YouTube integration. This will help us assess how you structure projects, think independently, and solve real-world backend tasks.

## Requirements
You should:
- Use Django (mandatory)
- Define models for YouTube videos and their comments
- Build API endpoints to expose videos and comments for frontend use
- Simulate incoming videos and comments (mocked, not real YouTube API)
- Generate comments via an AI-like function (simple logic is fine)

You decide how to structure the API and simulate content updates.

## Bonus (Optional)
- Include a Docker setup for local dev
- Use Celery to simulate scheduled content generation
- Add basic engagement stats, e.g., most-commented video
- Include tests, metrics/logging, or admin panel features
- Deploy it to a free hosting service

## Deliverables
- Push your code to a public GitHub repo
- Include a README with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Any assumptions or shortcuts
  - What you'd improve with more time
